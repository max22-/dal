<h1>December Adventure</h1>
<p>The goal is to write a little piece of code every day in december. See <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">here</a>.</p>

<p>Mine is to experiment a way of representing trees that i learnt in this talk by Aaron Hsu : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzPd3umu78g">Dyalog '18: High-performance Tree Wrangling, the APL Way</a>. 
The APL language is used in this video, but it is accessible even if you don't know it (which is my case, i only played a tiny little bit on tryapl.org). The key idea is to represent a tree as a 1-dimensional array of nodes,
each node contains its data, and a reference to its parent (and eventually one to its left sibling).</p>
<p>At the end of the talk i was thinking "what about parsing ? it would be neat if we could do it the same say", 
and a couple of days ago, i've stumbled upon this talk, by Aaron Hsu again : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5I4YPkVU7mY">Text Processing in APL // Aaron Hsu // Dyalog '22</a>.
It's very interesting and completely different from other parsing techniques. This <a href="https://youtu.be/5I4YPkVU7mY?t=692">section</a> is my preferred part of the talk. He explains that no recursion is used :
instead of a call stack, the AST being built is used as a "reified" stack, and it becomes also easy to do good error reporting. (mind blown). I've watched this section several times. Not sure i've understood everything yet.</p>
<p>I've tried a little bit in C, but for the December Adventure i'll give it a try with <a href="https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html">uxntal</a>. I am not very good at uxntal, it will be an opportunity to get a little bit better.
I really don't know what I am doing, but i think it will be fun.</p>

<h2> 01/12 and 02/12 </h2>
<p>
I've tried several times to write a little language inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_(programming_language)">Joy</a>. I'll try to parse that : <br>
<code>[dup 0 = [1 drop] [dup 1 - fac *] ifte] ' fac def</code>
</p>

<p>So i've set up a uxntal skeleton. Hardcoded that line of code. The idea of the parsing technique of Aaron Hsu is that a string can be thought of a tree where each character is a tiny little branch 
(and then multiple passes refine the structure of the tree).
Then i've implemented a function to add nodes to a tree, and another to transform a string into a tree. Tonight i've started writing another to display a node, which is not finished yet. 
<a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/beetbug">Beetbug</a> was very useful :) </p>

<h2> 03/12 </h2>
<p>Today i've implemented tree displaying (and corrected some bugs). I can now print a tree where the leaves can only be characters. Tomorrow i will maybe add other types like integers, etc. 
    And i will generate a tree with a more complex structure to see if it displays correctly. I also have to find why there is a #02 remaining on the working stack at the end of the program... </p>

    <h2>04/12</h2>
    Today I have hard-coded this to create an example tree:
    <p>
        <pre>
        <code>
#0000 .type/LIST #0000 ;tree1 add-node
#00 LIT "a .type/CHARACTER #0000 ;tree1 add-node
#00 LIT "b .type/CHARACTER #0000 ;tree1 add-node
#00 LIT "c .type/CHARACTER #0000 ;tree1 add-node
#0000 .type/LIST #0000 ;tree1 add-node
#00 LIT "d .type/CHARACTER #0004 ;tree1 add-node
#00 LIT "e .type/CHARACTER #0004 ;tree1 add-node
#00 LIT "f .type/CHARACTER #0004 ;tree1 add-node
#04d2 .type/INTEGER #0004 ;tree1 add-node
#162e .type/INTEGER #0000 ;tree1 add-node
;tree1 print-tree
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>The prototype of the add-node function is this :</p>
        <code>@add-node ( data* type parent* tree* -: )</code>
        
        <p>And the output of print-tree is this :</p>
        <pre>
        
        <code>
00010 nodes
LIST
    a
    b
    c
    LIST
        d
        e
        f
        01234
    05678
        </code>
        </pre>
        It took me quite some time because i've found some bugs in the code.
